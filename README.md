 <Challenge 1 Demo>

## Description

This is my first homework assignment on modifying an existing starter code provided as part of my bootcamp coursework.

My job in this homework was to refactor the starter code of an existing marketing site to improve its accessibility.

My contribution includes the following:
- improved accessibility by replacing exsiting non-descriptive elements with semantic elements (where possible)
- added alt descriptors to images (where relevant)
- added a short descriptive title element (in the header; metadata)
- removed redundant selectors in the CSS by consolidating identical selectors (within the {}) where possible
